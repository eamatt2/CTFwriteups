We are given a an image that contains the flag
My first thought was to check the metadata of the image to see if the flag was hidden there
In the metadata we can see that the attribution url contains the string cGljb0NURntNRTc0RDQ3QV9ISUREM05fM2I5MjA5YTJ9Cg==
When we put this string into a Base64 decoder, we are given the flag
