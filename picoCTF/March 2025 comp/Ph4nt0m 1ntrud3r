You are given a pcap file that contains captured packets

In Wireshark I sorted the packets from Latest packet to earliest packet

When going from Latest to earliest, I noticed that the latest packetes contained base64 chunks in their flag segments
After going through each flag in descending order that had base64 I got the chunks

cGljb0NURg==              (Latest packet)
ezF0X3c0cw==              (2nd Latest packet)
bnRfdGg0dA==              (etc....)
XzM0c3lfdA==
YmhfNHJfOQ==
NjZkMGJmYg==
fQ==

Which after decoding them gave me the flag picoCTF{1t_w4snt_th4t_34sy_tbh_4r_966d0bfb}
