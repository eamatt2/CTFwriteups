In this ctf we are tasked with cracking the hashes to find the respective password associated with that hash

The first hash that we are given to crack is 482c811da5d5b4bc6d497ffa98491e38
  We notice that the hash itself is 32 characters long which is pretty normal for an MD5 hash. If we run this in a hashcracker, I used CrackStation, and have it run MD5 hashes we get password123 as the output

The second hash that we are given to crack is b7a875fc1ea228b9061041b7cec4bd3c52ab3ce3
  We notice that the hash itself is 40 characters long which is normal for a SHA1 hash. If I run it through the same website the output is letmein

The last hash we are given is 916e8c4f79b25028c9e467f1eb8eee6d6bbdff965f9928310ad30a8d88697745
  Similar to the previous hashes, if we look at the length of this hash we can see that it is 64 characters long like a sha256 hash normally is. The output for this hash is qwerty098

After inputting those three passwords, we are given the flag picoCTF{UseStr0nG_h@shEs_&PaSswDs!_dcd6135e}
