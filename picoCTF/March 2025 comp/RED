We are given a png of the color red

We can easily assume tht the image contains the flag so if we upload the image into https://www.aperisolve.com/ we can see different tools applied to the image

If we scroll down to the zsteg (a ruby tool that detects and extracts hidden data from PNG and BMP files) we can see the base64 string cGljb0NURntyM2RfMXNfdGgzX3VsdDFtNHQzX2N1cjNfZjByXzU0ZG4zNTVffQ==
If we decode that string we get the flag picoCTF{r3d_1s_th3_ult1m4t3_cur3_f0r_54dn355_}
