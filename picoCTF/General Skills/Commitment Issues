We are given a challenge.zip file
we will cd into drop-in where we will see just a message.txt file
if we run ls -la we will see that there is also a .git file in there
.git is version control for a repository
if we run git init we can start a repo there
now we will use git log so that we can find the log history 
now we will run git checkout e720dc26a1a55405fbdf4d338d465335c439fb3e 
now if we run cat message.txt we will see the flag
