In this CTF we are given a very large zip file that contains a large amount of files and folders
It is not a good idea to manually check each file and folder as this would take ages
We can use the grep command which is a command that searches for specific patterns and text in files
If we extract the file and then run grep -r "picoCTF" files

Our command can be broken down like this 
-r recursively searches the directory we speficy
"picoCTF" is the string pattern that we are searching for
files is the directory that we are searching through

Using this command we are given the flag picoCTF{f1nd_15_f457_ab443fd1}
