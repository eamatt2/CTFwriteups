We are given two files, level2.py and level2.flag.txt.enc

If we look at the code for level2.py, our password checker, we can see that it is checker the user input and comparing it to the expected input
We can see the if statement
  if( user_pw = chr(0x34) + chr(0x65) + chr(0x63) + chr(0x39) ):

0x34 is 4 in ascii
0x65 is e in ascii
0x63 is c in ascii
0x39 is 9 in ascii

that means that it is expecting 4ec9 as the password input 
after running python3 level2.py and then typing in 4ec9 we are given the flag picoCTF{tr45h_51ng1ng_9701e681}
