You are given two files titled level1.py and level1.flag.txt.enc

If we open the level1.py file we want to look at this function

def level_1_pw_check():
    user_pw = input("Please enter correct password for flag: ")
    if( user_pw == "1e1a"):
        print("Welcome back... your flag, user:")
        decryption = str_xor(flag_enc.decode(), user_pw)
        print(decryption)
        return
    print("That password is incorrect")

We notice that the if statement is checking the expected input vs the user input
Now we want to run the program with the command python3 level1.py which then prompts us for an input
Your input will be 1e1a and this will cause the program to output the flag picoCTF{545h_r1ng1ng_fa343060}
