In this challenge we are directed to a website were a Log In is required that onyl contains letters and numbers
My first thought was to use BurpSuite to see how the login was handled through requests
After I made a dummy account, I noticed that through one of the requests we are given a url titled /secure.js
After looking throught this URL we can see that there is a function formatted like this:

function checkPassword(username, password)
{
  if( username === 'admin' && password === 'strongPassword098765' )
  {
    return true;
  }
  else
  {
    return false;
  }
}

This function tells us the username and password that the site is checking against
If we go back to the login page and use the credentials that the secure.js URL had given us, we can then be given the flag picoCTF{j5_15_7r4n5p4r3n7_a8788e61}
