We need to open up burpsuite and then set our target site to the site that we are given in the challenge
We will then go through the entire registration process until we get to the webpage that says "Invalid OTP"
Now we will look at our BurpSuite requests and responses
If we look at the POST for the /dashboard path, we can see that there is an OTP field at the bottom
If we delete the OTP field we are then given the flag because no OTP field means that we are able to bypass
