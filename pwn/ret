We first can run the code as gdb ret

Now we can run info functions to see the functions that are used in the binary

Then we can add a break at main, and when we do we see that there is a function called "func"

Next we can disassemble that function by running "disas func"

After inspecting the disassembly, we notice that their is a scanf call and shortly after it compares the scanf input to deadbeef and pon success it will jump.

We can seee that the start of the buffer is ebp-0x4c and the end of the buffer is ebp-0xc. This is an offset of 64 bytes. At the end of this offset we need to include deadbeef so that we pass the string compare check. 
Now we also need to get to the ret address at ebp +4 this is an additional 12 bytes so in total we need to overflow with 76 bytes to reach the win function
  
Now in our script we know what the overflow(76) amount is so we can substitute that into it
