LEVEL 0 -> 1
ssh into the account using ssh -p 2220 bandit0@bandit.bandit.labs.overthewire.org
then use ls to find the readme file and then use cat to read the file

LEVEL 1 -> 2
After logging into the next user, you are given the taks to read a file named "-"
first we must cd .. to get to the home directory
next we will use cd bandit1 to get to the directory for this level
In Linux you cannot just do cat - as the "-" symbol could direct you to stdin
You can use the command "cat < -" in order to get the contents of the file

LEVEL 2 -> 3
Similar to the previous level, we are tasked to read afile that has spaces in its name
You can use the comand cat "spaces in this filename"
The quotations around the filename allow you to read the spaces

LEVEL 3 -> 4
